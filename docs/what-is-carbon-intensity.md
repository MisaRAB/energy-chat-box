# What is carbon intensity?  
Tags: glossary, basics  

**Carbon intensity** is a fancy way of saying: *how much invisible smoke goes “puff!” into the sky when we make electricity.*  
Adults write it as **gCO₂/kWh** (boring!), but you can just think of it as the **“smokiness” of your power.**  

Why does it change?  
- On a **windy day**, the windmills spin like giant pinwheels → hardly any smoke.  
- When everyone **switches on TVs, ovens, and game consoles at once**, the gas machines wake up → lots of smoke.  
- If a big power station is **taking a nap for repairs**, other machines have to help → could be clean ones, could be smoky ones.  

Quick guide:  
- **Wind, sun, and nuclear** = squeaky-clean sparks (not much smoke).  
- **Coal and gas** = smoky, sooty sparks (lots of smoke).  

Think of carbon intensity as the **“smoke score”** on your electricity.  
A low score is like drying clothes on a sunny line outside.  
A high score is like roasting marshmallows inside your bedroom — super smoky!

# How do carbon intensity forecasts work?  
Tags: method, forecast, basics  

A **carbon intensity forecast** is like a weather forecast — but instead of rain and sunshine, it predicts how smoky the electricity will be!  

How do they guess? The grid operators peek into their crystal ball (okay, really it’s computers) and check:  
1. **How much power people will want** — like knowing if it’s a school day, a weekend, or super hot weather (lots of air conditioners!).  
2. **How much clean power will show up** — is the sun shining? is the wind blowing? are any machines resting or broken?  
3. **How smoky each fuel is** — coal, gas, wind, solar, nuclear… each has its own “smoke score.”  

A simple way to think about it:  
> Forecast smokiness = (how much each fuel is used) × (how smoky that fuel is)  

But! Forecasts aren’t perfect:  
- **Weather** can surprise us (windy one minute, calm the next).  
- **Machines** can break down or need fixing.  
- The forecast is updated often, whenever better info arrives.  

So, think of these forecasts like **today/tomorrow’s smoke-o-meter.**  
They’re great for planning what to do now… but not for predicting what the sky will look like in the year 2040!

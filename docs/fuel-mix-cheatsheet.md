# Fuel mix cheatsheet  
Tags: cheat, mix, glossary  

The “fuel mix” is just the recipe for how electricity is cooked up.  
Different ingredients make the power more or less smoky:  

- **Wind**: clean and breezy → hardly any smoke.  
- **Solar**: sunny and shiny → clean in the day, but snoozes at night.  
- **Nuclear**: the steady wizard → makes lots of power with tiny smoke.  
- **Hydro**: splashy rivers and dams → clean and flexible (if there’s enough water).  
- **Gas**: the quick helper → jumps in when people want more → makes medium smoke.  
- **Coal**: the sooty troll → lots and lots of smoke.  
- **Imports**: power borrowed from neighbors → could be clean, could be smoky, depends on their recipe.  

So:  
- If the mix is heavy on **wind, sun, or nuclear wizardry** → the smoke score is low.  
- If **gas or coal** are running the show → the smoke score is high.  

Easy way to remember:  
**“WIN-SUN-NUKE = low smoke, GAS-COAL = uh-oh smoke!”**
